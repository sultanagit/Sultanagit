## Hey there, I’m Talha Sultana 👋

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub — where models sometimes behave, pipelines occasionally don’t break, and coffee is the true source of all magic (and bugs). ☕

- 🔭 I’m currently building and fine-tuning machine learning models that aim to make life smarter (or at least my to-do list shorter).
- 🌱 Deep into MLOps, learning how to make AI systems reliable and production-ready, one deployment at a time.
- 👯 Looking to collaborate on projects where data meets code — and magic (mostly debugging) happens behind the scenes.
- 🤔 Need help with model tuning, deployment, or want to chat about the latest AI trends? I’m your go-to.
- 💬 Ask me about Python, AI, MLOps, or why “epoch” is my new favorite word (and not just because it sounds cool).
- 📫 Reach me at: talhasultana2003@gmail.com or by carrier pigeon (email preferred — pigeons can be slow).
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her, but also ‘That girl who talks to her computer like it’s a coworker’.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I spend more time naming variables than deciding what to build.

Hey, you made it this far! Go on, explore my world of data wizardry and model madness. Spoiler: It’s cooler than it sounds. ✨
